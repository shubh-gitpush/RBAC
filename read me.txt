I would like to thank vrv security for providing me this oppourtunity here i have explained my work

#I have created a blog with the help of html,css,bootstrap,djanngo(backend),javascript(jquery),sqlite
#i have implemented role based access control in admin panel of django.
#i have also created login and logout page for my blog
#i have created 4 types of user
superuser(grant all access)
admin(grant access by superuser)
moderator(grant access by admin or superuser)
user(grant access by above 3)

i have also implemented decorators like permission_required(which user can access),loginrequired(login required) in view.py
 for example in my views.py i have defined that moderator can't add comments directly,however he can add it from admin panel of django if superuser grants him that permission
 #first open the project and go to the folder where manage.py is present in this case\blog\blog>
and type manage.py runserver
 #TO go to admin panel http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
 password:SHUBH@2005(for all users)
 superuser:SHUBH
 moderator:moderator
 admin:SHUBH1
 These are allusername you can login via these credentials
 either in admin page or login page of blog

 I would like to again thank you for providing me this oppourtunity
